        LRLP_POSTAG_SOURCE: Either coarse POS tags such as "punct", "word", "twitter", "unknown", "url", "number", "email", or "numstring", or full POS tags.

        AUTHOR: Name of author if available
        POST_DATE_TIME: If available, posting info of the article
        CLUSTER_ID: If available, comparable cluster to which this segment belongs
        ANNOTATIONS: Denotes annotations are available for this segment
         ANNOTATION: a semantic annotation labeled by task: FE (full named entity annotation)/NE (simple named entity annotation)/SSA (simple semantic annotation)/NPC (noun phrase chunking)
           HEAD: Extent of the head of the annotation
           ENTITY_TYPE: (for NE/FE) LOC/NONE/ORG/PER/TTL
           ANNOTATION_KIND: (for FE) HEAD or MENTION
           MENTION_TYPE: (for FE) NAM/NOM/None/PRO/TTL
           PHRASE_ID: (for FE) phrase this annotation refers to (the phrase is usually another annotation and this is the head)
           ENTITY_ID: id of the entity this mention refers to
           ROLE: (for SSA) act/state
        	 NPC_TYPE: type of np chunking
      TARGET: signifies the target component of the segment. Includes document-local segment id, start and end (inclusive, 0-based) char offsets of 'ORIG_RAW_SOURCE'
        FULL_ID_TARGET: target-side document id (usually similar to source-side id)
        ORIG_RAW_TARGET: original form of target segment. This canonical form is used as a reference by any annotations
        MD5_HASH_TARGET: MD5 digest of the tokenized target. The data may contain duplicate segments, which we did not remove, in order to keep the context intact. This field can be used to efficiently detect duplicates.
        LRLP_TOKENIZED_TARGET: Tokenization as provided in the original LRLP.
        LRLP_TOKENIZED_LC_TARGET: Lowercased version of LRLP_TOKENIZED_TARGET
